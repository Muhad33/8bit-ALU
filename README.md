# ⚙️ 8-bit ALU Design in Verilog

## 📌 Introduction
This project implements an **8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using **Verilog HDL**.  
The ALU performs **arithmetic** (Addition, Subtraction) and **logical** (AND, OR, XOR) operations.  
A **testbench** was created for functional verification, and the design was simulated on an FPGA workflow.

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/8-bit-ALU-Verilog.git
cd 8-bit-ALU-Verilog/src
```

1.Open the files in your Verilog simulator (ModelSim / Xilinx / Cadence).

2.Compile the design:
```
alu.v → ALU design

tb_alu.v → Testbench
```
3.Run the simulation and observe the waveforms.

## 🧮 ALU Operations
| Opcode | Operation | Description |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- |
| `000`  | ADD       | `A + B`     |
| `001`  | SUB       | `A - B`     |
| `010`  | AND       | `A & B`     |
| `011`  | OR        | `A \| B`    |
| `100`  | XOR       | `A ^ B`     |
| `101`  | NOT       | `~A`        |
| `110`  | INC       | `A + 1`     |
| `111`  | DEC       | `A - 1`     |


✅ Verified addition, subtraction, and logical operations.

✅ Testbench validated outputs for multiple test cases.

✅ Waveforms confirm correct ALU functionality.

Got it ✅ I’ll prepare a complete README.md file for your 8-bit ALU project in ready-to-use format. You can directly copy this into your GitHub repo.

⚙️ 8-bit ALU Design in Verilog
📌 Introduction

This project implements an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL.
The ALU performs arithmetic (Addition, Subtraction) and logical (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) operations.
A testbench was created for functional verification, and the design was simulated on an FPGA workflow.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

🔹 Verilog HDL

🔹 ModelSim / Xilinx ISE / Cadence (depending on environment used)

🔹 FPGA Development Workflow

🔹 Digital Design & Simulation
